# SeisP MÃ³vil, an eDOTS app for Android
Developed in partnership with [Socios en Salud](http://sociosensalud.org.pe), this is an app to track directly observed treatments (DOTs) to increase adherence rates to treatments for diseases like tuberculosis.

Part of Harvard's [Tech in the World](http://techintheworld.org/) program, a winter break fellowship that sends computer science students to work on international development software projects with nonprofits abroad.

Based in part off [ankitvgupta/eDOTS](https://github.com/ankitvgupta/eDOTS), which the Tech in the World team developed in January 2015, and [jtomaylla/SeisP120](https://github.com/jtomaylla/SeisP120), which Juan Tomaylla (formerly of Socios en Salud) created in 2014 and 2015.
