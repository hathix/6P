# SeisP MÃ³vil, an eDOTS app for Android
Developed in partnership with [Socios en Salud](http://sociosensalud.org.pe), this is an app to track directly observed treatments to increase adherence rates to treatments for diseases like tuberculosis.

Based in part off [ankitvgupta/eDOTS](https://github.com/ankitvgupta/eDOTS), which the Tech in the World team developed in January 2015.
